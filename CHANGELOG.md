# Changelog

All notable changes to the documentation site are recorded here. Versioned
snapshots of the site are published on `v*` tags via [mike](https://github.com/jimporter/mike);
this file explains what changed between them.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Backend TLS Verification and Client Certificates page: certificate registry
  entries by usage (`ca`, `client`), `mtls_backend.verify_server_cert`,
  `backend_ca_cert_id`, `backend_client_cert_id`, `backend_tls_server_name`,
  the read-only `backend_tls_effective` state, the `backend_tls_verify`
  capability, in-place policy changes, certificate rotation, and the upgrade
  notes for the retired `mtls_backend` path and inline-material arguments.
  The frontend mTLS page, configuration reference, running modes, CLI
  reference and troubleshooting no longer describe backend verification as
  not wired.
- Admission Flow Control guide: the per-rule capacity admission gate
  (`fc_mode`, ceilings, bounded queue, adaptive ceiling, warm-up, tenant fair
  share, admission headers), its refusal codes, configuration examples for
  `curl` and `loxicmd`, metrics and troubleshooting. The `fc_*` fields,
  `loxicmd create lb --fc-*` flags, admission metrics, and maintenance drain
  behavior are reflected in the configuration reference, CLI reference,
  monitoring, troubleshooting, and readiness/maintenance pages.
- Open-source project scaffolding: governance, maintainers, contributing guide
  (with DCO and Conventional Commits policy), full Contributor Covenant v2.1
  code of conduct, security policy, issue/PR templates, Dependabot, CI
  (hygiene, strict build, link check, secret scan), and mike-versioned deploys.
- Documentation for the AI gateway feature set: model load balancing, LLM
  routing, KV-cache-aware routing, P/D disaggregation, vLLM/SGLang
  integration, SSE & quota management, API key management, MCP gateway, and
  the full configuration reference.
- Security guides (OPA L4 policy, mTLS for AI backends), operations guides
  (monitoring, Grafana, troubleshooting, audit logging), management-plane
  guides (LoxiLB UI, OAM API), and reference pages (API, CLI, system
  requirements).

### Changed

- Load-balancer rules: what a `POST` for an existing rule does (which omitted
  fields a replace keeps, what is applied in place, what restarts), and the
  refusals of a create or a replace (`400` naming `externalIP` or
  `tls_ciphers`, `409 lbrule-exists`, `412 LB_DATAPLANE_INSTALL_FAILED`).
  `tls_ciphers` states that the one string must serve TLS 1.3 and TLS 1.2.
  `POST /config/cert` answers with the `certId`. A rule read reports the
  member timeouts, the TLS-tuning fields and `mtls_frontend.client_crl_path`.

- Prepare a Supported Model: TensorRT-LLM as a single pool. The installer's
  `--engine trtllm`, the per-engine probe sets, the engine options file and
  launch line, block size 32, and the readiness causes specific to that
  engine. TensorRT-LLM Integration: a strict rule with a model profile, the
  engine's Prometheus path (`/prometheus/metrics`; `/metrics` is a queue a
  read empties), and the restart that exits with `Address already in use`.

- Backend TLS page and troubleshooting: a rule whose endpoints turn the
  gateway away after the TLS handshake (no client certificate named, or one
  they do not accept) now answers `502` (HTTP/1.1) or `503` (HTTP/2)
  `backend_unreachable` with a complete response and a data plane log line,
  where the connection was closed without an answer; and a backend TLS policy
  change or certificate rotation now closes kept-alive HTTP/1.1 client
  connections of a relaying rule once nothing is owed on them (at the latest
  after 30 seconds), where re-creating the rule was advised.
- Documentation hardening ahead of the public release: placeholder
  credentials in examples, production TLS-verification guidance, OPA server
  hardening notes, checksum guidance for third-party downloads, and corrected
  implementation-status notes verified against the gateway source.
