# Verification status

This page identifies exactly which public source artifacts support the
monitoring claims in these docs. It separates source presence, workflow
membership, recorded scenario assertions, and deployment qualification. A
scenario checked into the repository—or referenced by a workflow—is not by
itself evidence that its latest run passed.

The frozen source for this page is Gateway commit
`a8d3ed567f0bcd338ab584ac353f62a9d4393995`. Git object IDs for every listed
scenario, validation script, and workflow are retained in the docs contract
fixture and checked for drift.

The Gateway commit pins eBPF submodule commit
`462a1e5412f46ca53574b9c079005bb3da3cfa20`. The comparison release
`v0.9.8.9-rc.1` pins
`5536a2117ad2ad1128900a0d808ad7dec2eee2b5`. This records the source delta; it
does not qualify either eBPF revision on a kernel or installed host.

## Evidence lanes

| Lane | Status represented here | What it proves | What it does not prove |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Source/static | Frozen and validated | Metric names, labels, activation classes, writer mapping, scenario code, and exact assertion IDs exist at the frozen commit | That any deployment emitted the series or passed a scenario |
| Public workflow membership | `wired` or `not wired` below | Whether the frozen workflow source invokes that scenario | A current green run, coverage of every case, or release qualification |
| Scenario assertions | Exact case IDs below | The public validation script contains those named checks | That those checks ran successfully against this docs change |
| Linux/runtime | Not run by this docs change | — | Installed-host behavior, backend delivery, or restart behavior |
| GPU/engine | Not run by this docs change | — | GPU model correctness, throughput, or engine-version qualification |
| Two-node HA | Not run by this docs change | — | Failover completeness, peer security, or loss-free state transfer |
| Release/product | Not established here | — | Approval, packaging, immutable artifact, or production readiness |

## Frozen claim ledger

| Claim area | Public source | Workflow membership | Exact frozen assertions | Claim boundary |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| JWT policy and token accounting | [`cicd/ai-jwtauth`](https://github.com/loxilb-io/loxilb-inference-gateway/tree/a8d3ed567f0bcd338ab584ac353f62a9d4393995/cicd/ai-jwtauth) | `wired`: `ai-gateway-sanity.yml` invokes the scenario | `G2`, `M4`, `U1`, `U2`, `UH1`, `UH2`, `UE`, `UE3` | Policy-store behavior and token-accounting assertions only; this set does not directly runtime-assert every JWT/JWKS metric |
| QoS HA and quota-scope metrics | [`cicd/ai-qos-ha-sync`](https://github.com/loxilb-io/loxilb-inference-gateway/tree/a8d3ed567f0bcd338ab584ac353f62a9d4393995/cicd/ai-qos-ha-sync) | `not wired` to a frozen GitHub workflow | `SYNC-1`, `SYNC-2`, `QOS-METRIC-1`, `QOS-METRIC-2`, `QOS-HA-013`, `QOS-HA-014` | Scenario source exists; no current public workflow-run or two-node qualification claim |
| P/D and worker scrape metrics | [`cicd/vllm-pd-disagg`](https://github.com/loxilb-io/loxilb-inference-gateway/tree/a8d3ed567f0bcd338ab584ac353f62a9d4393995/cicd/vllm-pd-disagg) | `wired`: `ai-gateway-sanity.yml` invokes the scenario | `TH1`, `TH2`, `TH3`, `TH4`, `TH5a`, `TM1b`, `TM2d`, `TN1`, `TN2b`, `TN3b`, `TN4b`, `TN5a`, `TN6b` | Source membership only; a current run and real GPU backend are separate evidence |
| Sockmap observability | [`cicd/sockmap-fullproxy`](https://github.com/loxilb-io/loxilb-inference-gateway/tree/a8d3ed567f0bcd338ab584ac353f62a9d4393995/cicd/sockmap-fullproxy) | `not wired` to a frozen GitHub workflow | `O-1`, `O-2`, `O-3`, `O-5`, `O-6` | Uses status/counter/reset observations; the manifest has no dedicated sockmap Prometheus family |
| Monitoring stack | [`cicd/monitoring`](https://github.com/loxilb-io/loxilb-inference-gateway/tree/a8d3ed567f0bcd338ab584ac353f62a9d4393995/cicd/monitoring) | `wired`: `monitoring-e2e.yml` and `monitoring-drill.yml` reference the scenario | Scenario-level validation; no stable public case IDs | Workflow membership is not a current run result |

## Metric evidence classes

The generated [metrics reference](metrics.md) records all 197 families marked
`release` in the frozen manifest. It distinguishes four upstream evidence
classes:

- `verified-runtime`: the upstream manifest records runtime evidence;
- `verified-static`: the writer is supported by static or unit evidence;
- `conditional-with-proven-writer`: the writer exists, but emission depends on
  an activated feature path;
- `writer-mapped`: a writer source is mapped, but runtime emission is not
  verified.

These classifications are per metric family. They do not promote the docs
build into Linux, GPU, HA, or release evidence. For an operational decision,
pair the catalog with a raw scrape, a controlled stimulus, an independent
backend or state oracle, and the deployment's immutable build identity.

## How drift is detected

The docs gate regenerates a candidate contract from a selected Gateway commit
and fails on changes to either Swagger file, the engine support catalog, the
metric manifest, the claim-evidence object IDs, or the existing engine scenario
evidence. PromQL examples are checked against the frozen release-scope family
names, label schemas, and documented closed label values.

This is a static consistency gate. Runtime, GPU, HA, and release approval stay
independent.
